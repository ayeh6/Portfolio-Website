## Overview

### The challenge

To create a portfolio website that showcases my projects and experiences using my current knowledge of HTML and CSS.

### User Story

AS AN employer  
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples  
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

### Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work  
WHEN I load their portfolio  
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work and how to contact them  
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation  
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section  
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work  
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications  
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application  
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others  
WHEN I click on the images of the applications  
THEN I am taken to that deployed application  
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices  
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

## My Process

### Built with

HTML  
CSS

### What I learned

Learned to use my previous knowledge of object-oriented programming to make elements that make sense on screen in terms of placement and what their purpose is. CSS is a cascading language, so I had to take into account the layering of styling that is applied to the html elements. I probably spent as much time adding code as to removing code just to make the style.css make more sense and to not have redundant classes.

### Continued development

I will be building on top of this portfolio to add links to each item and have dedicated pages that describe what each item is. Also making the page more dynamic to different screen sizes and more lively with hover animations.
